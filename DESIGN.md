The following technologies has been used in this project:

GitHub for a more efficient and secure way of coding in a team. 
Java 9 with IntelliJ IDEA for writing the backend code.
The Spring Framework for Java with the dependencies of:
Web for creating a web application
MySQL for a database having several tables without duplication
JPA for connecting to MySQL
H2 for test 
Thymeleaf as a Java web template engine

###The second milestone of the project:

The next step of this project development is to separate the two pages of sound engineer and sound assistant so that they can access the application on two devices. The engineer has access to everything from his/her computer but the assistant has access only to the sound assistant page on his/her tablet.
